# Code Refactor Starter Code
First I noticed the amount of div's with classes attached. I changed the div with a class of header to just a header, as well as the div with a footer class to just a footer. 

I made the main content you see a main element with the content class. 

I made the side bar on the right an aside element

I condensed much of the CSS that was repeating rules for seperate elements

I added Alt descriptions to the images
